There is power in praise during troubling times. Use the prayer below to give glory to God:</p><p>Father Lord, I thank You for being with my friend before the surgery. God, You have said in Your word that You will walk with us. Although we cannot see You near us, we trust and believe that You are here. Thank You for the medical procedure that is going to happen today. That You that You will be with my friend when he/she lies unconscious in the operation room. Your presence will surround him/her and comfort his/her mind. I am thankful that You will always be with him/her. Thank You, Everlasting Father, for the surgeons that are going to attend on my loved one. Bless them and let Your grace be with them. Receive all the honour and glory because this surgery will go well. Thank You because You are going to take care of my loved one. Thank You for promising us that You can never forsake us. Remind my loved one how that statement is true when he/she is in the surgery room. Thank You for everything and Your promises. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.</p><p>Dear God, You alone created all the things in this world. It is You alone that controls all the things. The outcome of this operation is one of the things that only You can control. I need everyone to feel Your presence in this surgery. We put everything in Your able hands. Today, we commit to Your sovereignty. As my friend is in the surgeons’ hands, let his body begin to heal. Lord, You are sovereign over every kind of creature. You are the only healer we have. Help my friend rely on Your power and not his/her. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p><p>Dear God, I have come to that You so much for my friend’s operation going well and with no complications. Even when there appeared to be complications, thank You because You lead and guide the doctors. Thank You, Father, for being with my friend. I pray that You may now help him/her to recover quickly. Let him/her relax and rest without complication for the coming days. Receive all the honour and glory for this operation. In Jesus’ name, I do pray, trust, and believe.

This will remove any fears and thoughts that the procedure might not be healing. Use the prayers below:</p><p>Loving God, Kings of Kings, I come before You to ask You for comfort in all my friend’s suffering. Lend Your hands to his/her doctors. Bless the means they use to cure my friend. Give my friend great confidence in the power of Your able hands. So that when he/she is afraid, he/she may put all the trust in You. Lord Jesus, by Your suffering in the cross, You gave us an excellent example of how we should be obedient to the Father. Be near my friend in times of his/her pain and weakness. Sustain his/her grace and heal him/her if it is Your will. I pray all these through our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Father, Your word tells us not to be worried about anything. It tells us that if we come before Your throne in prayer to present our petitions, You will give us peace in our hearts that passes the understanding of a man. This is what I am doing right now. Father, I bring before You my lovely grandparent who is about to face the surgery. I am asking You Father to be with my grandparent. Keep him/her heart calm so that she may not think about all that could go awful in the course of the surgery. Although this is very daunting, I know that my grandparent will successfully go through the procedure by Your power. I pray that You give him/her peace in his/her heart. Let my friend’s soul find rest in You. Help him/her not to worry or fret during this challenging operation time. I pray that he/she will not be anxious about the procedure’s outcome but rather leave everything to You. Let him/her understand that You are a gracious God who can cause everything to work for the good of those You love. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p><p>Father Lord, I surrender everything to You today. I submit my loved one to You. I present his/her medical procedure to You. I trust that You will be in control of everything that will occur today. I trust that You will be with my friend in the surgery room when I am outside waiting. You are the only creator of life. Nothing can sustain itself without You. Our breath comes from You. I pray that You may keep my friend in Your hands this day. I trust in You, for You are the mightiest God. Please let this procedure go on without any complications. Let the recovery process be quicker, painless, and restful. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.</p><p class=align-left>A prayer for someone having surgery is one way of ministering to their needs.
