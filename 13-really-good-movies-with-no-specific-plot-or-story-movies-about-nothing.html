While some film buffs specialise in genres like film noir or independent historical fiction, others love any movie with a gripping, dramatic plot. Regardless of their particular interests, all cinephiles agree that watching a movie in a theatre is the best way to do it. The majority of moviegoers like films with clear plots that they can follow from the outset. But occasionally, as every cinephile will attest, watching a movie when nothing happens is just as thrilling as watching any other movie.</p><p>In fact, as Uproxx reveals, <a href=#>Netflix</a> noticed a spike in <a href=#>The Office</a> views during the early stages of the pandemic. Many people had a lot of downtime when the planet was initially quarantined. However, working from home quickly became the new standard, with some people watching The Office while they worked. Long before the pandemic struck about three years ago, people were enjoying this unhurried viewing on the big screen. Pauline at the Beach and the animated picture My Neighbor Totoro are examples of magical movies where nothing happens. However, films with no storyline have a purpose, similar to The Office while in quarantine: to let the audience unintentionally and carelessly enjoy a story. Here are the top movies with minimal action.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Amour</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Archipelago</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Before Sunset</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Clerks</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Inside Llewyn Davis</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> L’Avventura</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Lost in Translation</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> My Neighbor Totoro</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Pauline at the Beach</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Right Now, Wrong Then</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> The Big Lebowski</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> The Station Agent</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> Tokyo Story</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Amour>Amour<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Amour.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>A married couple in their 80s named Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) and her husband Georges are the focus of the French love drama Amour (Jean-Louis Trintignant). They are former piano instructors who now reside in Paris. Following a necessary procedure, Anne is left with right-side paralysis. Georges takes on the role of her carer and brings in nurses when he is unable to. Unfortunately, Anne has a stroke and requires more care than Georges can provide.</p><h3><span id=Archipelago>Archipelago<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Archipelago-1.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Tom Hiddleston starred in a few movies with Joanna Hogg before becoming popular as an MCU anti-hero. Archipelago, which takes place on the Isles of Scilly, is one of these movies. To perform volunteer work for an organisation, Edward (Hiddleston) is preparing to depart for the African continent. His mother and sister offer to host a farewell gathering at their cottage on the Isles of Scilly before he departs.</p><h3><span id=Before_Sunset>Before Sunset<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Before-Sunset.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Before Sunset, the third film in director Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy, picks up nine years after the first meeting between Jesse (<a href=#>Ethan Hawke</a>) and Céline (Julie Deply).

The reason Clerks has been successful for almost three decades is that it is still applicable to those with dead-end jobs. In the movie, Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and Randall, his best buddy, try to fill their workday with as many activities as possible, including playing roof hockey. Local drug traffickers Silent Bob (Smith) and Jay (Jason Mewes) cause problems for Dante and Randall.</p><h3><span id=Inside_Llewyn_Davis>Inside Llewyn Davis<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Inside-Llewyn-Davis.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Inside Llewyn Davis, a Coen Brothers movie, features <a href=#>Oscar Isaac</a> as Llewyn, a struggling folk performer in the 1960s.

Bob (Billy Murray) travels to a faraway nation to serve as the spokesperson for an established product because he is desperate to resurrect his acting career. He keeps running into Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) in their different hotels while he’s in Tokyo. The film’s final scene, when Bob whispers something into Charlotte’s ear before they part ways, is the most exciting scene because it was spontaneously created by Murray and Johansson and will always be kept between them as a secret.</p><h3><span id=My_Neighbor_Totoro>My Neighbor Totoro<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/My-Neighbor-Totoro.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>One of the most well-known films from <a href=#>Studio Ghibli</a> is perhaps the third feature. The story of My Neighbor Totoro centres on two sisters who have just relocated to a new home near the hospital where their mother is recovering. Their antics include riding a cat-shaped bus in the pouring rain and assisting their crops to shoot upward. My Neighbor Totoro has the perfect amount of adventure, fantasy, comedy, drama, and slice of life that you need in one film, according to Sugoi Mart’s review of the movie.</p><h3><span id=Pauline_at_the_Beach>Pauline at the Beach<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pauline-at-the-Beach.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Pauline (Amanda Langlet) and her cousin Marion (Arielle Dombasle) consider their ideal relationships while simultaneously going through the difficulties of those relationships while on a family summer vacation. Teenager Pauline observes as Marion and her more mature and experienced friends talk about love. Pauline thinks that love takes time to develop while Marion thinks it can happen instantly. Pauline at the Beach, another <a href=#>French movie</a> on our list, is as languid as it is inventive.</p><h3><span id=Right_Now_Wrong_Then>Right Now, Wrong Then<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Right-Now-Wrong-Then.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Streaming services have long been dominated by South <a href=#>Korean movies</a>. According to DW, South Korean stardom in Hollywood is referred to as “Hallyu.” The two-part movie Right Now, Wrong Then analyses the concept of a chance encounter between two people. A filmmaker named Ham Cheon-soo (Jae-young Jeong) meets Yoon Hee-jeong (Kim Min-hee), a local artist, during the opening act of the movie and falls in love with her right away. At a gallery opening, Yoon ends their close relationship with Ham.

The Dude enjoys bowling a lot and prefers to dress in loungewear even when not relaxing. Although he is not the first person to wear loose pants in public, The Big Lebowski’s success inspired the creation of the Dudeism religion, whose tenets are similar to those of Chinese Taoism, the philosophy of balance. However, dudeism uses comedy to support this balance.</p><h3><span id=The_Station_Agent>The Station Agent<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Station-Agent.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Actor Peter Dinklage played Finbar McBride in Tom McCarthy’s directorial debut, The Station Agent, before he rose to fame as <a href=#>Tyrion Lannister</a> in <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>. Together with his best buddy Henry, Finbar runs a model train shop in Hoboken, New Jersey, where they both reside (Paul Benjamin). Despite his passion of railroads, he sticks to himself since he feels judged because of his height. He meets Emily (Michelle Williams), a librarian with a terrible relationship, and this all changes.</p><h3><span id=Tokyo_Story>Tokyo Story<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tokyo-Story.jpg alt="movies where nothing happens reddit,movies where nothing happens but the vibes are there,bad movies with no plot,movies with simple plots,slice of life movies,movies that are slow,top 25 romantic movies,best foreign romantic movies,movies where nothing happens,best movies reddit,best movies about struggle,best movies about existence,best movies about founders,best movies about nature,best movies about universe,best movies about solitude,best movies about aliens,best movies about real events" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>A retired couple named Shikichi and Tomi Hirayama, along with their daughter Kyoko (Kyoko Kagawa), reside in Japan.
