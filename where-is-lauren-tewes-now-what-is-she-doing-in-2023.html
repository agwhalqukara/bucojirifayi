What is She Doing In 2023?</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Lauren Tewes</strong> is a&nbsp; well-known personality; made her started in the entertainment sector in 1976, playing a tiny role in the crime thriller Charlie’s Angels. Tewes went on to feature in a number of other TV shows during the 1970s. Her career took off, however, when ABC hired her as Julie McCoy Chenault in The Love Boat, a romantic comedy cruise series.</p><p>Tewes won the job after competing against over a hundred other females. From 1977 until 1987, she featured in over 200 episodes of the show. She was sacked from the show in 1984, however, after a series of claims of drug misuse. She did appear on the program as a guest star in 1985 and 1998.</p><h2>What Is Lauren Tewes Up To These Days?</h2><p>Tewes is still working as an actor at the moment. Her most recent film appearance was in the 2021 release of the dark comedy Potato Dreams of America. She also sometimes performs voice work for video games. She also works as a sous chef for a catering company in Seattle when she is not performing. Furthermore, in November 2021, it was reported that Tewes would be appearing on The Love Boat in an honorary capacity. The portion commemorating the late actors of the series, MacLeod, will be presented by Princess Cruise Celebrations. Tewes will co-star alongside Bernie Kopell, Ted Lange, Jill Whelen, and others on the program.</p><h2>Lauren Tewes: How Did She Get Started?</h2><p>Tewes was cast the day before the third Love Boat pilot was scheduled to begin production. She was picked from a pool of 100 other actresses when producer Spelling saw her on an episode of Starsky & Hutch in which she had appeared. She was advised to be at the set early the following morning. Her car had a flat tire, and she was poor, so she borrowed the money, fixed the tire, and joined the next day as requested. She’d previously been in nearly a dozen commercials and had one line in a Charlie’s Angels episode that year. But The Love Boat was the much-needed reprieve she’d been looking for.</p><h2>What Impact Does Her Substance Abuse Have on Her Career?</h2><p>Unfortunately, her journey from struggling performer to television fame was not without setbacks. It was the 1970s, and she was quite wealthy. It didn’t take long for her to blow most of it on cocaine. “It gave me a sensation of amazing joy. You believe you are in good health. You believe you are stronger and braver than others. It gave me the courage I lacked, I reasoned. It was like going to Oz and requesting bravery. Instead, I received cocaine, “Tewes said (as per UPI.). Because of a spate of no-shows, she was fired a few years before The Love Boat ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lauren-Tewes-1.jpg><p>“I was attempting to maintain my career, my spouse, and my home. I was ruining myself while trying to satisfy everyone. I was high on drugs. I didn’t get any sleep. I dozed off at work. I misbehaved at work, and it was there that I made my deadly error, “Added the actress. Tewes started withdrawing after realizing she was “not having a good time” and was “dying herself.” She said that she would have taken a pay cut to try to make things right, but it was too late, and Pat Klous stepped in as Julie’s younger sister, Judy.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4ylmK6qlaN6tbHWnqpmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fortyfine45-the-lord-will-never-forsake-me-actress-funke-akindele-says-as-she-celebrates-45t.html>&#171;&nbsp;#Fortyfine45:The Lord Will Never Forsake Me- Actress Funke Akindele Says As She Celebrates 45t</a>
