As a couple, there is the joy of procreation, and the absence of it brings sorrow. As a businessman or woman, a high return from investment brings much joy. However, what happens if things go the other way?</p><p class=align-left>Also, sorrow for specific medical ailments is not left out. The<a href=#> drama series</a> shows that everyone undergoes one challenge or another.</p><p class=align-left>As things begin to intensify, relationships grow cold, and several fetish acts begin to creep in. So it was for Trent.
