As soon as we got back to the studio we sat down and wrote this song which is about embracing life, being a bit confused about the whole experience but realising that life is too short so let’s just go for it.</p><p><strong>Life is super short, What do you do to try and live in the moment?</strong></p><p>Well, I live by the sea and that’s my therapy in a way. I often go swimming which is really nice and obviously I have to do the whole social media thing because of being in the music industry but I try to keep it as real as possible.</p><p><strong>And with social media do you ever feel the pressure to be, act or look a certain way?</strong></p><p>I think if I was younger I would because I feel sorry for teenagers these days because I struggled as a teenager without social media so I can’t imagine that now but I’m very open about mental health online and super passionate about that so I just try and keep it real in the hope that it helps someone else. I think it’s important if someone sees someone might have this ‘perfect’ life to know that they have struggles regularly and if I’m honest I feel down half the time I’d say because this job is so up and down and there are huge highs but there are days when you feel rubbish and I just feel that being totally transparent about that with people who might follow you online is really important to me and I think people do appreciate it.</p><p><strong>And when you have those down days is there anything in particular which lifts your spirits or comforts you?</strong></p><p>I like to walk or run by the sea and listen to music really loud but usually fresh air and being by the beach.</p><p><strong>You’ve also got an EP coming soon, what can you tell us about that?</strong></p><p>Well, I released Parallel world and lights which are both on the EP and the rest of the EP is coming out September time I believe. There’s a couple of songs on there that I’ll be performing this evening and I’ve played them at a couple of previous shows and they seem to have gone down well so it’s nice.</p><p><strong>Out of all of your songs which would you say is most special to you?</strong></p><p>I would say it’s probably a song called ‘Disconnected’. I wrote it about 10 years ago before my brother went to Afghanistan with the army and I finally released it last year with a military charity so that’s the song I connect with and is most important to me. All my songs have different jobs but that one is the one if I had to take just one with me.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you still get nervous when you perform, if so, do you have any pre-show rituals to try and calm you down?</strong></p><p>I do but I feel like if I’m prepared then it’s a good nervous but if I’m not then it’s a bad nervous. In terms of rituals, I would say drinking some whiskey.</p><p><strong>How does it feel for you, especially with the emotions involved in your songs, to know that they will actually be released for people to hear?</strong></p><p>I really like that feeling because I feel like when I’m on stage and being on stage is something that I love the most, I love the writing, but I really appreciate the writing more when I’m on stage.</p><p><strong>Lastly, what would you say the highlight of your year has been so far and what are you most excited about for the rest of the year?</strong></p><p>Highlights so far this year has to include today because today is a massive highlight for me, also the two shows I did with Tom Jones were incredible. I’m excited because I have a couple of shows at the Hammersmith Apollo coming up and next week I’m performing in Paris which is my first show abroad. Oh, I also have my biggest ever headline show in London in November so there are lots of things to look forward to.</p><p>Jazz Morley released a brand new single <a href=#>‘Jackie and Wilson’</a> today which is available to stream across all major platforms and tickets to her November headline show are available via her<a href=#> website</a>.</p><p>Be sure to keep up with Jazz Morley on <a href=#>Facebook</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a> and <a href=#>Instagram</a> and let us know what you thought of the Interview over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksrmvy66qoq6VYrCmuMSbpKKwXZi1osDSZq6irJhit6LG2WakqKqcmsZurdNmmaysXZ3GpbGMqZiro18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chris-brown-s-alleged-gf-ammika-harris-shows-off-belly-in-calculated-pictures-as-rumors-about-an.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chris Browns Alleged GF, Ammika Harris, Shows Off Belly In Calculated Pictures As Rumors About An</a>
