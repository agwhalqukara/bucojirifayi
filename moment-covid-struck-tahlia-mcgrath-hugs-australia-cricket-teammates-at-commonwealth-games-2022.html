Australia cricket teammates at Commonwealth Games 2022</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 8 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p class=mol-para-with-font>Australia’s decision to field a cricketer with&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-84470eb0-16e3-11ed-8b1a-77d7d586c598 class=class>Covid-19</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Commonwealth Games has sparked controversy and claims of hypocrisy given the country’s hard line on lockdowns during the pandemic – and their decision to deport Novak Djokovic over his vaccination status.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tahlia McGrath&nbsp;was permitted to play&nbsp;at Edgbaston in <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-3129ecf0-16e0-11ed-8b1a-77d7d586c598>Birmingham</a> yesterday despite testing positive. She&nbsp;bowled and batted in the match and also took the catch that dismissed <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-312b4c80-16e0-11ed-8b1a-77d7d586c598 class=class>India</a>‘s star opener Shafali Verma as the Southern Stars took gold.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She batted at No4 without a mask before she was dismissed after scoring just two runs off four balls. McGrath then bowled two overs for 24 runs and also took a catch, when she held up her hands to warn her fellow players not to come and celebrate with her.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But when they won the game,&nbsp;McGrath jumped into the huddle and hugged her teammates. Australian bowler Megan Schutt said afterwards: ‘If we get Covid, so be it’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Had the match been played in Australia, McGrath would have been forced to isolate for seven days. But in the UK, where self-isolation rules are advisory only,&nbsp;Ms McGrath could play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She had woken up with mild symptoms yesterday morning and then returned a positive test. However, she was still selected in the Aussies’ XI after tournament organisers approved her participation following consultations before the toss, which was delayed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>McGrath did not line up with her team-mates during the pre-match national anthems and did not join them in the dugout while they were batting, instead sitting in the stands wearing a mask.&nbsp;After taking part in the match, Tahlia wore a mask at the medal ceremony and as she celebrated gold with her teammates on the podium, where she had her arms around&nbsp;Beth Mooney and Alana King.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She is understood to be the first player known to have Covid to take part in an international cricket match, with Birmingham allowing each positive athlete to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But critics have said she should not have been allowed to play.&nbsp;Many Indian supporters felt the decision was ‘racist’ and that India would have been ruled out of the final if the shoe was on the other foot. There was also anger because Indian para discus athlete&nbsp;Aneesh Kumar Pillai was banned from his Commonwealth final in Birmingham after testing positive for Covid-19. The virus was picked up by a random swab – and he was&nbsp;asymptomatic – but the&nbsp;Commonwealth Games Federation said he couldn’t take part.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There were also claims of hypocrisy by the Australians, given their very hard line on lockdowns and vaccination to slow the spread. Their strict rules led to Novak Djokovic being excluded from the Australian Open tennis and deported – despite him not having Covid-19.&nbsp;Former prime minister Scott Morrison even spent&nbsp;$2billion of taxpayers’ money on quarantine facilities now scattered around Australia that sit unused and empty.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One Australian tweeted that McGrath’s participation ‘makes a mockery of all the isolation we had to endure for the last three years’.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-57c1021d75dd1ac8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/08/08/61170227-11090857-image-a-25_1659943963558.jpg height=531 width=962 alt="When the gold was assured, Tahlia McGrath was right in the middle with her teammates hugging them, despite having covid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>When the gold was assured, Tahlia McGrath was right in the middle with her teammates hugging them, despite having covid</p><img decoding=async id=i-2f4ed59f967dbdbd src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/08/07/61168497-11090857-image-a-10_1659938537036.jpg height=579 width=470 alt="Tahlia McGrath takes the catch that dismissed India's star opener Shafali Verma as the Southern Stars took gold." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><img decoding=async id=i-3be4a2a4d95620b8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/08/07/61168495-11090857-image-m-9_1659938533018.jpg height=579 width=470 alt="She warned her teammates not to come to celebrate with her" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Tahlia McGrath takes the catch (left) that dismissed India’s star opener Shafali Verma as the Southern Stars took gold.

No-one’s testing, no-one’s doing anything. It’s just a real shame she couldn’t celebrate with us, but at the same time I think the right decision was made in terms of letting her play. Hopefully people aren’t too upset about it’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indian captain&nbsp;Harmanpreet Kaur said they found out about the positive covid test just before the toss. She said: ‘That was something not in our control. The CWG had to take a decision and we were okay with it since she [Tahlia McGrath] wasn’t very ill, so we decided to play. We had to show sportsman spirit. I’m happy we didn’t say no to Tahlia, it [missing the final] would have been very hard-hitting for her.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sports reporter Naveen Sharma slammed the move as ‘shameless’ in a Tweet: ‘Australians always preach about right or wrong but they forget everything when it comes to them.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Tahlia McGrath tested Covid positive. Yet she was allowed to play. Basically, all rules go haywire when Australia and England play.

Imagine same happening with any Asian player they wouldn’t have allowed at all,’ said another.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If the same would happen with Asian team the match would have been abandoned and opposition would get the gold,’ another posted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘How could this be possible… The umpires already stole the women’s hockey semi-final from India too against Australia with bad umpirism, too much favouritism for Australia,’ posted another.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A number of cricket fans pointed to Australia refusing to let tennis champion Novak Djokovic play in the Australian Open and called us hypocrites for allowing McGrath to play.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So Australia can deny Djokovic from playing in the Australian Open for not being vaccinated but will allow a Covid +ve [sic] person to play a cricket match? And what is the point of testing if a Covid positive person can still play?’ Mantavya asked in online commentary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It wasn’t just Indian supporters shocked and appalled by the decision, with many Australian fans questioning the decision as well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The team they played against should appeal to health organisation it’s highly dangerous and not legal to endanger others health. Australia would be up in all sorts if it was other way around especially if we lost,’ one Aussie fan posted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Absolute rubbish!
